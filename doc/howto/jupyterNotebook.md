# TL;DR

Jupyter notebook and jupyter lab are python notebook environments.  Note that CTDS maintains several jupyter Docker images in https://github.com/uc-cdis/containers/


## Jupyter Noteboboks

When running Jupyter Notebook workspaces we recommend using

```
"args": ["--NotebookApp.base_url=/lw-workspace/proxy/","--NotebookApp.password=''","--NotebookApp.token=''"],
"command": ["start-notebook.sh"],
"path-rewrite": "/lw-workspace/proxy/",
"ready-probe": "/lw-workspace/proxy/",
"user-uid": 1000,
"fs-gid": 100
```

to disable authentication as this is a single user container when run with Hatchery. This also sets the paths to be correct as well as the user IDs.

## Jupyter Lab

Jupyter lab is the successor to jupyter notebook.

      "cpu-limit": "1.0",
      "memory-limit": "1024Mi",
      "name": "Jupyter Notebook Bio Python- Make your own",

      "args": ["--NotebookApp.base_url=/lw-workspace/proxy/","--NotebookApp.password=''","--NotebookApp.token=''"],
      "command": ["start-notebook.sh"],
      "path-rewrite": "/lw-workspace/proxy/",

      "user-uid": 1000,
      "fs-gid": 100,
      "user-volume-location": "/home/jovyan/pd",
      "gen3-volume-location": "/home/jovyan/.gen3"
